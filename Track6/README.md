# Track 6

The Xcode project in this directory contains algorithms for:

* [Introduction to Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci)](Algorithms%20(Xcode%20Project)/Fibonacci)
* [Sieve of Eratosthenes](Algorithms%20(Xcode%20Project)/SieveOfEratosthenes)
* [Capturing Rainwater](Algorithms%20(Xcode%20Project)/CapturingRainwater)
* [The Knapsack Problem](Algorithms%20(Xcode%20Project)/Knapsack)

Each tutorial is represented by a separate directory and build target. Within each directory, the `main.swift` file contains the algorithms for that tutorial; the `benchmarks.swift` file contains performance tests.

The [Assets](Assets) directory contains article images that should be uploaded to Author.
