# Track 6

The Xcode project in this directory contains algorithms for:

* [Introduction to Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci)](https://github.com/john-royal/Pass-the-Technical-Interview-with-Swift/tree/main/Track6/Algorithms%20(Xcode%20Project)/Fibonacci)
* [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://github.com/john-royal/Pass-the-Technical-Interview-with-Swift/tree/main/Track6/Algorithms%20(Xcode%20Project)/SieveOfEratosthenes)

Each tutorial is represented by a separate directory and build target. Within each directory, the `main.swift` file contains the algorithms for that tutorial; the `benchmarks.swift` file contains performance tests.

Algorithms for the following articles will be added when ready:

* Capturing Rainwater
* The Knapsack Problem
