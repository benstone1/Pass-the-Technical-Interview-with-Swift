# Author 

[Author](https://author.codecademy.com/) is Codecademy's in-house content management system. If you don't have access to Author, please reach out to me as soon as possible.

## Process

* When narratives and checkpoints drafts are revised and finalized, you will move on to adding content in Author.
* If you have any external assets to display as a workspace or in the narrative, please let me know and I'll provide you with a link that you can use in markdown.
